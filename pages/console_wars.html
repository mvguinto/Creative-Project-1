      <h1>Console Wars</h1>
      <p class="disclaimer">Disclaimer: While PC is a major gaming platform, we have omitted it from our wars as it is not technically a console, since it was not created for that purpose. We will admit that a lot of preference of console depends on
        personal preferences and which console you were raised playing. These are based on our personal experiences and opinions.</p>

          <h2>Sony PlayStation</h2>
          <p>The PlayStation, in Maleah's mind, is the superior gaming console. Some of the greatest games of our time have been created for PlayStation. While some of these games have been later released for other consoles, they started as a
            PlayStation exclusive. It also seems to support the more graphically stunning games. It's by no means a perfect console. However, technology is something that is constantly impoving and changing. This is why our wallets cry everytime a
            new edition is released.</p>

          <h2>Microsoft Xbox One</h2>
          <p>In our opinion the Microsoft Xbox One is the weakest of the three major consoles. As of late there does not seem to be much of a point to owning one. There is little exclusivity to their gaming library, since most of their games can be
            found on other consoles or PC. This does not mean that the console is bad, it is just the least desirable at this point in time.</p>

          <h2>Nintendo Switch</h2>
          <p>The whole idea around the Switch, being both a home and mobile console, may seem like a gimmick. However, it is a gimmick that actually works. Being able to play your favorite game anywhere is just amazing. You can start playing at home
            then, when it is time to go catch your bus, just take it out of its dock to continue your play-through on the bus. Not only is the Switch mobile, it has many great exclusive games not found anywhere else. With such games as The Legend of
            Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Super Mario Oddessy, it is hard to beat its game library.</p>
