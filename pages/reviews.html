        <p>As a lover of the first game, I have to say that I am disappointed so far. I don't think the transition to the switch was done very well. It's either all touch screen, or use the remotes. I would have appreciated the use of the controllers
          without removing them from Switch. The original game depended heavily on the dual screen feature of the DS, and I don't think the gameplay works as well on a single screen. Additionally, I think they should have included built in cheats
          like many of the other rereleased games have done, expecially since the main reason I am playing is to see the added content. I have played the original game multiple times, I don't need to do all the grinding again. I'll save my full
          critique until I have finished the game.</p>

          <h2>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Review</h2>
          <h5>By: Derek Hensley</h5>

        <p>Embrace all the nostalgia. Although the game is now over two decades old, this is still one of my favorite games ever. I still remember playing this as a kid with this game kicking off my love for the entire Zelda franchise. What can I say
          about it. It brought out the adventurer in me. Being able to explore the vast expanse of Hyrule searching for people to help or dungeons to beat. If there was a negative thing was while Hyrule was quite large, it was pretty empty with only
          a few places even worth exploring. The dungeons on the other hand were full and always keep you occupied and are just fun. Another thing I have recently found to make this game even more replayable is randomizers. By mixing up where items
          are found, each play-through is completely different and I highly recommend this new experience.</p>

          <h2>Baba is You Review</h2>
          <h5>By: Derek Hensley</h5>
        </div>
        <p>I just recently found this game, and already love it. Baba is You is a puzzle game where the puzzles are based around changing the rules. Who knew that allowing the players to make the rules themselves would allow for not only a fun, but
          hard experience. Most of the levels are built in such a way that there is only one solution. This can be aggravating at times since you seem so close but are in reality very far from the true answer. There are also some really cool
          mechanics that are used in just one level, than never seemed to be touched again which is just sad. However this is a great game, I highly recommend it to anyone. While it is hard, it is fun and fulfilling when you finally figure out the
          single level after three hours of hard thinking. <p>

          <h2>Pokemon Sword Review</h2>
          <h5>By: Maleah Guinto</h5>

        <p>3 words: Not their best. I both liked and didn't like the more open world format they chose to pursue. I liked it because it was fun to explore; I didn't like it because I found myself stuck in that area for hours. I also didn't like how
          they blocked you from capturing higher level pokemon. I understand it from a trading standpoint; you shouldn't be able to get a 100 level Pokemon when you don't even have a badge. However, if I have trained my pokemon enough to catch a
          higher level pokemon, or if I simply want to test my luck, I should be able to try and catch them. I was also disappointed in the available legendaries. I finished the game and was ready to go find all the extra legendaries, only to find
          that I had already gotten them. While the addition of seeing all the wild pokemon chasing you was fun, it took a lot of the random out of random battles. All in all, I didn't think this game stood out to me in the Pokemon series</p>
