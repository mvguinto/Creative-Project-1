# Creative-Project-1

For this lab, you will create a basic website using HTML and CSS. This website can be for anything you want, but should not be too similar to the website you built for Lab 1. You must create your own original work. You creative projects can build on each other.

This is your chance to be creative and build anything you want -- a book store, a social media site, or anything else. You are welcome to provide "fake" data for the website. For example, you can't build a complete clone of Instagram, since you won't have a database, interactive front end, etc. But you could mock up what a clone of Instagram would look like, including pages to show a stream of photos, upload a photo, login to your account, etc.

You are also welcome to use the creative projects throughout the semester to slowly build up a big project. So if you want to build a store, you could start mocking up some of the pages for this project, and then add other parts later. If you build a single website over the course of multiple creative projects, you must add new functionality in each assignment.

## Pair Programming
You are welcome to use pair programming for this assignment. With pair programming,  two students work together at one workstation. One takes the role of the "driver" and writes code while the other takes the role of the "observer" to review each line of code as it is typed in and offer suggestions. The two students switch roles frequently during the project. The two students should have relatively equal levels of experience.

Pair programming is not assigning different parts of the project to two different people, and then meeting later to put the work together. You must follow the above guidelines for pair programming.

## Requirements
This is a creative project, so you are welcome to build what you would like. The basic requirements are:

* A home page
* Three or more additional pages
* The site uses some images
* The site uses Bootstrap for a menu
* A footer that lists the URL for your GitHub repository

## Submission
On Canvas, submit the URL for your website, which should be running on your DigitalOcean server.

You should also enter your name, your partner's name (if any), and your URL on this spreadsheet (Links to an external site.). Be sure to select the appropriate tab at the bottom!

Rubric for Grading
We will grade your projects based on:

* You met all the requirements
* How well you follow web design principles: spacing, typography, color, consistency, and responsive design.

TAs will assign scores in these ranges:

* 90-100: Excellent use of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap menu, Bootstrap grid (or CSS grid or flexbox) to make columns, meets requirements, clearly follows web design principles
* 80-90: Uses most of the tools, good effort was made, but missed some requirements and/or needs work to more clearly present the data or follow web design principles
* 70-80: Uses some of the tools, but misses several requirements, and/or does not make a strong effort or follow web design principles
